# 1 About #

A specialized version of the classic Upload field for images: 

- it accepts only images: bmp, jpg, jpeg, png and gif.
- optional, set a minimum width and / or height. If 0 or empty, no minimum limit will exist.
- optional, set a maximum width and / or height. If 0 or empty, no maximum resize limit will exist.
- optional, it will create unique filenames.

**NB:** The resize takes places upon save, no matter new entry or edit entry.
